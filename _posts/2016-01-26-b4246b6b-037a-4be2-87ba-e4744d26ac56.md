**This is Ghana be something else!**

All you need to do to get a good picture of Ghana is drive
along a remote road for about an hour, preferably on a Saturday.

I've gotten used to being surprised when I go to new
countries. They inevitably do not match
up with my expectations -- good or bad. And just as inevitably, there is no way to possibly understand the
intricacies of that culture and its nuances prior to arrival. Instead, I just try to notice, see it as it
is, and understand even a limited amount.

This is easier said than done in a country as colorful as
Ghana. Markets are a blur of patterns,
cloth, yelling market women, hustling, sprinting laborers, somewhere a
loudspeaker going full blast alternating between the evangelistic zeal of a
local preacher and the pumping beats of 90's club music. You are threatened both high and low simultaneously
by a minefield of legs and children and produce and refuse, while also having
to duck under umbrellas, stall shades, and the aggressively large head-loads of
women shopping. A medley of smells
engulfs you upon entry. At the entrance you leave behind the cloyingly acrid
exhaust of the relentless traffic in exchange for a baseline of dried fish,
dirt and human exertion, with highlights of roasting corn, ripening bananas,
and crushed citrus. The atmosphere is
palpable. 

Within that productive chaos, it is difficult to
focus on details -- but that's where the real differences are.
